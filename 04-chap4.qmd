# Types of Variables {#sec-chap4}




## Components of a datset

1.  Each variable must have its own column.

2.  Each observation must have its own row.

3.  Each value must have its own cell.


## penguins dataset

1.  How many variables and observations are there in the data set?

2.  What are the variable names?


Variable description

```{r}
colnames <- colnames(penguins)
description <- c("penguin species (Adélie, Chinstrap and Gentoo)", 
                 "island in Palmer Archipelago, Antarctica (Biscoe, Dream or Torgersen)", 
                 "bill length (millimeters)", 
                 "bill depth (millimeters)", 
              "flipper length (millimeters)",
              "body mass (grams)",
              "penguin gender (female, male)",
              "the study year (2007, 2008, or 2009)")
df <- data.frame(colnames, description)
colnames(df) <- c("Variable name", "Variable description")
df |> knitr::kable()
```

```

## Qualitative/ Categorical Variables

-   Describes categories or groups

-   Non-numeric (no numerical meaning)

-   Examples:

    -   colors: red, blue, green\
    -   gender: male, female
    -   types of animals: non-mammal mammal

Your turn: Identify qualitative variables in the penguins dataset.

## Quantitative Variables/ Numerical Variables

-   Represents measurable quantities

-   Numeric

-   Examples:

    -   Height in cm
    -   Weight in kg

Your turn: Identify quantitative variables in the penguins dataset.

## Discrete vs Continuous

### Discrete

-   Represent countable quantities

-   Can take on only specific, distinct values (whole numbers)

-   No intermediate values between consecutive values

-   Examples:

   -   Number of students in a classroom
   -   Number of cars in a parking lot
   -   Number of books on a shelf

### Continuous

-   Represent measurable quantities

-   Can take on any value within a given range, including fractions and decimals.

-   Infinite number of possible values within a range.

-   Examples:

  -   Height of individuals
  -   Temperature
  -   Time taken to complete a task


#### Your turn: Identify discrete and continuous variables

```{r}
df |> knitr::kable()
```

## Scales of measurement

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("chap4img/scales.png")
```

## Nominal Scale


-   The simplest measurement scale

-   Named variable levels

-   No numerical meaning

-   They have no natural order.

-   Categories are mutually exclusive.

-   The difference between values can’t be evaluated.
 
**Examples**


-   Blood type: O-, O+, A-, A+, B-, B+, AB-, AB+

-   Hair color: Blonde, black, brown, grey

-   District you live

## Ordinal Scale

-   The simplest measurement scale

-   Named variable levels

-   No numerical meaning

-   They have a natural order.

-   Categories are mutually exclusive.

-   The difference between values can’t be evaluated.

**Examples**

Income: Low income, medium income, high income

Customer Satisfaction: Very Dissatisfied, Dissatisfied, Neutral, Satisfied, Very Satisfied

Grade: A+, A, A-, B+, B, B-


## Interval Scale


These variables have

-   a natural order

-   a numerical meaning

-   a quantifiable difference between values

-   **no** true zero value

**Examples**

-   Temperature: Measured in Fahrenheit or Celsius

-   Marks: Measured from 0 to 100

## Ratio Scale


These variables have

-   a natural order

-   a numerical meaning

-   a quantifiable difference between values

-   a true zero value

**Examples**

-   Height: measured in centimeters.

-   Weight: measured in kilograms.
