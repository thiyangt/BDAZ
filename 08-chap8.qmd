# Statistical Inference: Estimation

In this section we discuss  how can we use sample data to estimate values of population parameters?

**Point estimation** and **Interval estimation** are the two forms of population parameter estimation based on sample data.

## Point Estimation

Provides a single best guess for the population parameter.

The statistical properties of point estimators (Unbiased, Efficiency, Consistency) are out of the scope of this book.


| Population Parameter | Point Estimator |
|----------------------|-----------------|
| Population Mean | Sample Mean |
| Population Variance | Sample Variance |
| Population Proportion | Sample Proportion |

**Note:** Each point estimator provides the best single-value estimate of its corresponding population parameter, based on a **random sample**.

Question:

A zoologist collected data on the **body weight (in kg)** of 6 randomly selected **adult cheetahs** from a wildlife reserve.  
The recorded weights are as follows:

$$
42,\ 47,\ 39,\ 45,\ 44,\ 43
$$

Additionally, out of these 6 cheetahs, **4 were identified as healthy** based on veterinary examination.

**Tasks:**

1. Estimate the **population mean body weight** of adult cheetahs.  
2. Estimate the **population variance** of body weight.  
3. Estimate the **population proportion** of healthy cheetahs.

## Interval Estimation

While a **point estimate** gives a single best guess for a population parameter, it does not indicate how reliable that estimate is.  
**Interval estimation** provides a **range of plausible values** within which the true population parameter is likely to lie.

The general form of an interval estimate is as follows:

The general form of a confidence interval (CI) is:

$$
\text{Point Estimate} \ \pm\ \text{Margin of Error}
$$

### Confidence Interval for the Population Mean ($\mu$)

| Condition | Confidence Interval Formula | Distribution Used |
|------------|-----------------------------|--------------------|
| **Population standard deviation $\sigma$ known** | $$ \bar{x} \pm z_{\alpha/2} \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}} $$ | Standard Normal $z$) |
| **$\sigma$ unknown, population normal** | $$ \bar{x} \pm t_{\alpha/2,\,df} \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}} $$ | Student’s \(t\)-distribution ($df = n-1$) |
| **$\sigma$ unknown, large sample** | $$ \bar{x} \pm t_{\alpha/2,\,df} \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}} $$ | Student’s \(t\)-distribution or Standard Normal distribution |
| |$$ \bar{x} \pm z_{\alpha/2} \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}} $$ | |


### Confidence Interval for the Population Proportion ($\theta$)

| Condition | Confidence Interval Formula | Distribution Used |
|------------|-----------------------------|--------------------|
| **Large sample $n\hat{p} \ge 5$, $n(1-\hat{p}$ \ge 5$** | $$ \hat{p} \pm z_{\alpha/2} \sqrt{\frac{\hat{p}(1-\hat{p})}{n}} $$ | Standard Normal  |
| **Small sample or extreme proportions** | Use **exact (Clopper–Pearson)** or **Wilson interval** methods | Binomial-based |


#### Example:

A zoologist is studying the body length (in cm) of a rare frog species in a rainforest. She randomly captures 10 frogs and measures their lengths:

Sample data (body lengths in cm):

7.8, 8.2, 7.5, 8.0, 7.9, 8.1, 7.6, 8.3, 7.7, 8.0

Assume body lengths are normally distributed. Construct a 95% confidence interval (CI) for the population mean.

**Interpretation:**

We are 95% confident that the true mean body length of this frog species in the rainforest lies between 7.73 cm and 8.09 cm.

- This does not mean that 95% of the frogs have lengths in this range. It refers to the population mean.

- If we repeated this sampling many times, 95% of the calculated confidence intervals would contain the true mean.

**Rcode:**

```{r, echo=TRUE}
# Sample data (frog body lengths in cm)
frog_lengths <- c(7.8, 8.2, 7.5, 8.0, 7.9, 8.1, 7.6, 8.3, 7.7, 8.0)
# Compute 95% confidence interval using t-distribution
t_test_result <- t.test(frog_lengths, conf.level = 0.95)
# Display results
t_test_result
# Access CI directly
t_test_result$conf.int
```

#### Question 1


A researcher measures the wing length (cm) of a random sample of 15 hummingbirds:

Data: 6.5, 6.7, 6.9, 6.4, 6.8, 6.6, 6.7, 6.5, 6.9, 6.8, 6.6, 6.7, 6.5, 6.8, 6.6

Construct a 95% confidence interval for the average wing length of hummingbirds. Assume that wing lengths are normally distributed.


#### Question 2

A zoologist studies a population of butterflies in a forest. She randomly captures 120 butterflies and finds that 78 of them have blue wings.

Estimate the population proportion of blue-winged butterflies with a 95% confidence interval. Assume the sample is random and large enough for the normal approximation.
