# Statistical Inference: Estimation

In this section we discuss  how can we use sample data to estimate values of population parameters?

**Point estimation** and **Interval estimation** are the two forms of population parameter estimation based on sample data.

## Point Estimation

Provides a single best guess for the population parameter.

The statistical properties of point estimators (Unbiased, Efficiency, Consistency) are out of the scope of this book.


| Population Parameter | Point Estimator |
|----------------------|-----------------|
| Population Mean | Sample Mean |
| Population Variance | Sample Variance |
| Population Proportion | Sample Proportion |

**Note:** Each point estimator provides the best single-value estimate of its corresponding population parameter, based on a **random sample**.

Question:

A zoologist collected data on the **body weight (in kg)** of 6 randomly selected **adult cheetahs** from a wildlife reserve.  
The recorded weights are as follows:

$$
42,\ 47,\ 39,\ 45,\ 44,\ 43
$$

Additionally, out of these 6 cheetahs, **4 were identified as healthy** based on veterinary examination.

**Tasks:**

1. Estimate the **population mean body weight** of adult cheetahs.  
2. Estimate the **population variance** of body weight.  
3. Estimate the **population proportion** of healthy cheetahs.

## Interval Estimation

While a **point estimate** gives a single best guess for a population parameter, it does not indicate how reliable that estimate is.  
**Interval estimation** provides a **range of plausible values** within which the true population parameter is likely to lie.

The general form of an interval estimate is as follows:

The general form of a confidence interval (CI) is:

$$
\text{Point Estimate} \ \pm\ \text{Margin of Error}
$$

### Confidence Interval for the Population Mean ($\mu$)

| Condition | Confidence Interval Formula | Distribution Used |
|------------|-----------------------------|--------------------|
| **Population standard deviation (\(\sigma\)) known** | $$ \bar{x} \pm z_{\alpha/2} \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}} $$ | Standard Normal (\(z\)) |
| **\(\sigma\) unknown, population normal** | $$ \bar{x} \pm t_{\alpha/2,\,df} \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}} $$ | Student’s \(t\)-distribution (\(df = n-1\)) |
| **\(\sigma\) unknown, large sample  (\(n \ge 30\))** | $$ \bar{x} \pm z_{\alpha/2} \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}} $$ | Approx. Standard Normal (\(z\)) |


### Confidence Interval for the Population Proportion ($\theta$)

| Condition | Confidence Interval Formula | Distribution Used |
|------------|-----------------------------|--------------------|
| **Large sample (\(n\hat{p} \ge 5\), \(n(1-\hat{p}) \ge 5\))** | $$ \hat{p} \pm z_{\alpha/2} \sqrt{\frac{\hat{p}(1-\hat{p})}{n}} $$ | Standard Normal (\(z\)) |
| **Small sample or extreme proportions** | Use **exact (Clopper–Pearson)** or **Wilson interval** methods | Binomial-based |
