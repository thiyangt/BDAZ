Suppose there are n number of observations.\nLocate the middle value of the ordered array as follows\n\nMedian formula when n is odd\nMedian = (\\frac{n+1}{2})^{th} \\text{observation}\nMedian formula when n is even\nMedian = \\frac{(\\frac{n}{2})^{observation} + (\\frac{n}{2} + 1)^{observation}}{2}\nYour turn\nCompute the median for the following numbers.\nDataset 1:\n214, 215, 216, 105, 109, 8, 50, 1000, 150\nDataset 2:\n2, 3, 10, 11, 50, 5, 8, 9, 10, 5\nMean (Arithmetic mean)\nPopulation mean: \\mu\nPopulation size: N\n\\mu = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^Nx_i}{N}\nSample mean: \\bar{x}\nSample size: n\n\\bar{x} = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^nx_i}{n}\nYour turn\nDetermine the mean for the following numbers.\nQ1:\n214, 215, 216, 105, 109, 8, 50, 1000, 150\nQ2:\n2, 3, 10, 11, 50, 5, 8, 9, 10, 5\nMeasures of Dispersion\nRange: Maximum - Minimum\nAdvantages\n\nEasy measure\nEasy to understand\n\nDisadvatages\n\nIt only takes into account the maximum and the minimum value.\nHighly sensitive to outliers.\nDoes not provide information about the spread of data between the minimum and maximum values, nor does it indicate whether the data points are clustered or evenly distributed.\nVariance\n\nVariance is the mean squared deviations from the mean.\nMeasure of the spread of the data around the mean.\n\nPopulation Variance\n\\text{Population variance} = \\sum_{i=1}^N \\frac{(x_i-\\mu)^2}{N}\nN - population size\n\\mu - population mean\nSample Variance\n\\text{Sample variance} = \\sum_{i=1}^n \\frac{(x_i-\\bar{x})^2}{n-1}\nn - sample size\n\\bar{x} - sample mean\nAdvantages:\n\nVariance considers all data points in the dataset.\n\nDisadvantages:\n\nSensitive to outliers/ extreme values.\nThe units of variance are the square of the units of the original data, which can make interpretation difficult. For example, if the data are in meters, the variance will be in square meters.\nVariance is less intuitive to understand than other measures of dispersion like the range or interquartile range. People often find the concept of squared deviations harder to grasp.\nStandard deviation\n\\text{Standard deviation} = \\sqrt{Variance}\n\nThe variance and the standard deviation are measures of the spread of the data around the mean. They summarise how close each observed data value is to the mean value.\nStandard deviation is expressed in the same units as the original values (e.g., minutes or meters)\n\nIn datasets with a small spread all values are very close to the mean, resulting in a small variance and standard deviation.\nInterquartile Range (IQR)\nWe will talk about this after looking at measures of relative standing/ measures of noncentral location.\n\nMeasure of dispersion\n\nIQR = Q_3 - Q_1\n\nMeasure considers the spread in the middle 50% of the data.\nNot influenced by extreme values.\nMeasures of relative standing/ Measures of noncentral location\n\nQuartiles\nPercentiles\n\nQuantiles\nQuantiles are descriptive measures that split the ordered data into four quarters (four equal parts).\nQ1 - first (lower) quantile\nQ2 - second (middle) quantile\nQ3 - third (upper) quantile\n\nFirst quantile\n\nThe value which 25% of the observations are smaller and 75% are larger\nQ_1 = \\frac{n+1}{4} \\text{ ordered observation}\n\nSecond quantile\n\nSame as median\n\nThird quantile\n\nThe value for which 75% of the observations are smaller and 25% are larger\nQ_3 = \\frac{3(n+1)}{4} \\text{ ordered observation}\nPercentiles\n\nPercentiles divides a given ordered data array into 100 equal parts, it divides the complete data set into hundred groups of 1% each. There are total of 99 percentiles denoted as P1, P2, P3,…, and, P99, and they are known as 1st percentile, 2nd percentile,…., 99th percentile respectively.\n\nfirst decile = 10th percentile\nQ1 = 25th percentile\nQ2 = 50th percentile\nQ3 = 75th percentile\nninth decile = 90th percentile\nLocation of a percentile\nThe following formula allows us to approximate the location of any percentile.\nL_p = (n+1)\\frac{p}{100}\nwhere L_p is the location of the p^{th} percentile.\nTabular representation\n\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(palmerpenguins)\nlibrary(knitr)\n\npenguins |&gt;\n  summarise(\n    Minimum     = min(body_mass_g, na.rm = TRUE),\n    Q1      = quantile(body_mass_g, 0.25, na.rm = TRUE),\n    Median  = median(body_mass_g, na.rm = TRUE),\n    Mean    = mean(body_mass_g, na.rm = TRUE),\n    Q3      = quantile(body_mass_g, 0.75, na.rm = TRUE),\n    Maximum     = max(body_mass_g, na.rm = TRUE),\n    SD      = sd(body_mass_g, na.rm = TRUE),\n    N       = n()\n  ) |&gt;\n  kable(caption = \"Summary statistics for Penguin Body Mass (g)\")\n\n\nSummary statistics for Penguin Body Mass (g)\n\nMinimum\nQ1\nMedian\nMean\nQ3\nMaximum\nSD\nN\n\n\n2700\n3550\n4050\n4201.754\n4750\n6300\n801.9545\n344",

    "text": "5.10 Some rules\n\nDon’t make them 3D: 3D charts can distort data and make it difficult to accurately interpret values.\nDon’t use overly complex charts: Keep it simple. Overly complex charts can confuse the viewer and obscure the data.\nDon’t use excessive colors: Too many colors can be distracting and make the chart hard to read. Stick to a simple color palette.\nDon’t use misleading scales: Ensure the scales start at zero (when appropriate) and are consistent to avoid misrepresenting the data.\nDon’t use pie charts for too many categories: Pie charts are hard to interpret with more than a few slices. Use a bar chart instead.\nDon’t use inappropriate chart types: Match the chart type to the data you are presenting. For example, use line charts for trends over time and bar charts for comparing categories.\nDon’t omit axis labels and titles: Always label your axes and give your chart a clear, descriptive title.\nDon’t clutter with too much information: Avoid adding unnecessary elements like excessive gridlines, text, or data points.\nDon’t ignore accessibility: Ensure your charts are readable for people with color blindness by using colorblind-friendly palettes and providing text alternatives.\nDon’t make legends and labels too small: Ensure that legends and labels are large enough to be easily read.\nDon’t use default settings without customization: Default settings might not be the best for your data. Customize your charts to improve clarity and impact.\nDon’t ignore data source and context: Always provide the data source and context to help the audience understand where the data comes from and its relevance.",

Only adult, healthy elephants are selected based on expert judgment, ignoring juveniles or sick individuals.\n\n\nQuota sampling\nThe population is divided into subgroups, and the researcher selects a fixed number of subjects from each subgroup.\nAdvantages: Ensures representation of important subgroups.\nDisadvantages: Nonrandom selection within subgroups may introduce bias.\nExample\nA researcher wants to study male and female adolescent elephants:\nTotal population: 50 elephants\nQuota: 30 males and 20 females\nThe researcher selects individuals to meet the quota, not randomly within each sex.\n\n\nSnowball sampling\nSnowball sampling is a non-probability sampling technique in which existing study participants recruit future participants from among their acquaintances. The sample “snowballs” as more and more participants are referred by those already in the study.\nKey Features:\nOften used when the population is hard to reach or hidden, such as people with rare diseases, drug users, or marginalized communities.\nStarts with a small initial group (called “seeds”) who are known or accessible to the researcher.\nEach participant helps identify additional participants, increasing the sample size progressively.\nAdvantages:\nEfficient for reaching difficult-to-access populations.\nCan leverage participants’ networks to gain trust and participation.\nDisadvantages:\nBias risk: The sample may not represent the entire population, since people tend to refer others similar to themselves.\nDependence on initial participants: If the first “seeds” are not diverse, the sample may be skewed.\nExample:\nA researcher studying rare medical conditions starts with a few patients at a clinic. Each patient refers other patients they know who have the condition, and the process continues until enough participants are recruited.",
