# Probability and Distribution Theory {#sec-chap6}

## What is Probability?

- Probability is a quantitative measure
of uncertainty.

- A number that conveys the strength
of our belief in the occurrence of an
uncertain event.

## Terminology

1. Experiment

Statisticians use the word experiment to
describe any process that generates a set of
data.

This involves observing or counting or measuring.

2. Random Experiment

- All possible outcomes can be specified in
advance.

- It can be repeated in an identical fashion.

- The same outcome may not occur on
various repetitions so that the actual
outcome is not known in advance.

3. Outcomes

The results one obtains from an experiment

4. Sample space

The set of all possible outcomes of an
experiment.

5. Events

- An event is a subset of the set of all possible
results of some action or a process or a
procedure.

- Events are usually denoted by capital English
letters A, B, C, D, E etc.

- Events are of two types,

  - Simple event: An event containing only one
outcome

  - Compound event: An event containing more than
one outcome

6. Random Variable

Let $\Omega$ be a sample space. Let $X$ be a function
from $\Omega$ to $\mathbb{R}$ (i.e., $X: \Omega \to \mathbb{R}$). 
Then $X$ is called a random variable.


Random variables are denoted by capital
English letters.

## Axioms of probability

Axiom 1: For any event $A$, $P (A) ≥ 0$

Axiom 2: $P(\Omega) = 1$

Axiom 3: 

\textbf{Axiom 3:} 

(a) If $A_1, A_2, \dots, A_k$ is a finite collection of mutually exclusive events, then
$$
P(A_1 \cup A_2 \cup \dots \cup A_k) = P(A_1) + P(A_2) + \dots + P(A_k) = \sum_{i=1}^{k} P(A_i).
$$

(b) If $A_1, A_2, \dots$ is an infinite collection of mutually exclusive events, then
$$
P\Big(\bigcup_{i=1}^{\infty} A_i \Big) = \sum_{i=1}^{\infty} P(A_i).
$$



Axioms 1 and 2 imply that for any event $E$, $0 \leq P(E) \leq 1$.

The probability of an impossible event is 0.

The probability of an event that is certain to occur is 1.


## Interpretation of probability

- Relative frequency interpretation.

 The probability of an event $E$
related to a random experiment can be
interpreted as the ‘approximate
proportion of times that $E$ occurs if we
repeat the experiment very large number
of times.

Example: A wildlife biologist could then say that the probability that a randomly selected turtle from this population has the disease is 0.05. This means, if we observe a very large population of sea turtles in a certain coastal region, the proportion of turtles carrying a particular shell disease might be approximately 5%.

- Subjective interpretation.

Example: A marine biologist feels that there is a 60% chance that a rescued dolphin will successfully reintegrate into the wild, based on her past experience with similar rescues and her knowledge of the dolphin’s behavior.


## Methods for Determining Probability

- Classical method

- Relative frequency method

- Subjective method

- Using probability models

## Classical Method

- Probability is calculated based on the sample
space.

- No need to carry out any experiment. It is
enough to know the sample space.

- This approach can be used only if,

  - the sample space consists of finite
number of outcomes.

  - all the outcomes are ‘equally likely’
  
Then, the probability of event $E$ is given by,

$P(E) = \frac{n(E)}{n(\Omega)}$

## Exercise

Q1: What is the probability of
obtaining ‘Head’ in a single
toss of an unbiased coin?

Q2: Two fair dice are tossed. Find
the probability that sum of the
dice equals seven.

Q3: A box contains 3 white balls and 2 black
balls. Two balls are taken one after the
other without replacement. Write down
the sample space. Find the probability of getting one white
ball and one black ball.

$\Omega = \{(W,W), (W,B), (B,W), (B,B)\}$

Are the outcomes of this sample space
equally likely?

Can you write the sample space so that
outcomes will be equally likely?



## Relative frequency method (Empirical probability)

$$P(E) =\frac{\text{number of times E occurred}}{\text{number of times trial was repeated}}$$
## Exercise

Q1: A wildlife researcher observes 500 frogs in a wetland and records that 75 of them have a certain skin fungus.

Using the relative frequency approach, estimate the probability that a randomly selected frog from this wetland has the skin fungus.

Q2: During a bird migration study, a biologist counts 800 birds and finds that 160 of them are male sparrows.

Using the relative frequency approach, what is the probability that a randomly selected bird from this group is a male sparrow?

## Subjective Method

Usually based on an educated guess or
estimate, employing opinions and inexact
information.



## Conditional Probability

The conditional probability of an event $A$ given that event $B$ has occurred is denoted by $P(A \mid B)$ and is defined as:

$$P(A \mid B) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)}, \quad \text{for } P(B) > 0$$

## Multiplication Rule

Rearranging the formula of conditional probability, we get the \textit{multiplication rule}:

$$P(A \cap B) = P(A \mid B) \cdot P(B)$$


## Extension for multiple events
For three events $A$, $B$, and $C$, the multiplication rule can be extended as:

$$P(A \cap B \cap C) = P(A) \cdot P(B \mid A) \cdot P(C \mid A \cap B)$$



## Mutually Exclusive Events

Two or more events are **mutually exclusive** if they **cannot occur at the same time**.  

$$
P(A \cap B) = 0
$$

**Example (Zoology):**  
In a bird survey, observing a bird as either a **sparrow** or an **eagle** in a single sighting is mutually exclusive — the bird cannot be both at the same time.  



## Exhaustive Events
A set of events is **exhaustive** if **at least one of them must occur**, meaning they cover all possible outcomes.  

$$
P(A_1 \cup A_2 \cup \dots \cup A_n) = 1
$$

**Example (Zoology):**  
Observing a frog in a wetland, it must either be **male** or **female**. These categories are exhaustive because they cover all possible frogs.  


## Independent Events

Two events $A$ and $B$ are **independent** if the occurrence of one **does not affect the probability** of the other.  

$$
P(A \cap B) = P(A) \cdot P(B)
$$

**Example (Zoology):**  
The event that a **sea turtle lays eggs today** and the event that a **crab crosses the beach** are independent — one does not affect the other.

# Rules of Probability

## 1. Complement Rule
The probability of the complement of an event $A$, denoted by $A^c$, is:

$$
P(A^c) = 1 - P(A)
$$

## 2. Addition Rule
- **For any two events $A$ and $B$:**

$$
P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \cap B)
$$

- **For mutually exclusive events $A$ and $B$:**

$$
P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B)
$$

## 3. Multiplication Rule
- **Conditional probability:**

$$
P(A \mid B) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)}, \quad P(B) > 0
$$

- **Multiplication rule:**

$$
P(A \cap B) = P(A \mid B) \cdot P(B)
$$

- **Extension to multiple events $A_1, A_2, \dots, A_n$:**

$$
P(A_1 \cap A_2 \cap \dots \cap A_n) = P(A_1) \cdot P(A_2 \mid A_1) \cdot \dots \cdot P(A_n \mid A_1 \cap \dots \cap A_{n-1})
$$

## 4. Law of Total Probability
If $\{B_1, B_2, \dots, B_n\}$ is a partition of the sample space $\Omega$, then for any event $A$:

$$
P(A) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} P(A \mid B_i) \cdot P(B_i)
$$

## 5. Bayes’ Theorem
For events $A$ and $B_i$ with $P(B_i) > 0$:

$$
P(B_i \mid A) = \frac{P(A \mid B_i) \cdot P(B_i)}{\sum_{j=1}^{n} P(A \mid B_j) \cdot P(B_j)}
$$


## Exercise

Question 1

A wildlife researcher studies frogs in three ponds: Pond A, Pond B, and Pond C.

Pond A has 50 frogs, Pond B has 30 frogs, and Pond C has 20 frogs.

The probability that a frog in Pond A is infected with a skin fungus is 0.1, in Pond B is 0.2, and in Pond C is 0.3.

a) If a frog is randomly selected from all ponds, what is the probability that it is infected?

b) Suppose a randomly selected frog is found to be infected. What is the probability that it came from Pond B?

Question 2

A wildlife biologist tests a population of 1000 bats for a viral infection using a diagnostic test.

200 bats are actually infected.

The test correctly identifies 180 of the infected bats as positive.

Among the 800 uninfected bats, the test correctly identifies 720 as negative.

Tasks:

Calculate the sensitivity of the test.

Calculate the specificity of the test.
