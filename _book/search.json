    "text": "1.2 What is Biostatistics?\nWhen statistical methods are applied to specific fields, the discipline often takes on a specialized name. When statistical methods are applied to biological and medical sciences, it is called Biostatistics. Table 1 shows Specialized fields where statistics is applied.\n\n\n\nSpecialized fields where statistics is applied\n\nField\nDescription\n\n\n\nEpidemiology\nThe study and analysis of the patterns, causes, and effects of health and disease conditions in populations.\n\n\nAstrostatistics\nApplies statistical analysis to the understanding of astronomical data.\n\n\nBiostatistics\nStudies biological phenomena and provides statistical methods for analysis of biological data.\n\n\nDemography\nStatistical study of all populations, including size, distribution, and structure.\n\n\nSocial statistics\nStudy of human behavior in a social environment using statistical methods.\n\n\nChemometrics\nScience of extracting information from chemical systems by data-driven means.\n\n\nEconometrics\nUses economic theory, mathematics, and statistical inference to quantify economic phenomena.\n\n\nPsychometrics\nApplies statistical methods to psychological measurements, tests, and surveys.\n\n\nPharmacometrics\nModeling drug dose-response relationships, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics.\n\n\nBioinformatics / Biostatistics in Molecular Biology\nAnalyzes DNA, RNA, protein data, sequence alignments, and gene expression patterns.\n\n\nAgrimetrics / Agricultural Statistics\nStatistics applied to agriculture — crop yield trials, soil studies, plant breeding, pest control.\n\n\nEcological Statistics / Biostatistics in Ecology\nStatistics applied to ecology and wildlife studies — population surveys, species distribution, biodiversity indices.\n\n\nActuarial Statistics\nDiscipline that deals with assessing the risks in insurance and finance.\n\n\nForensic Statistics\nApplies statistics to analyze forensic data, including DNA testing results.\n\n\nSpatial Statistics\nAnalysis of spatially referenced data to detect patterns or relationships.\n\n\nJurimetrics\nApplication of probability and statistics to law and legal decisions.\n\n\nSports Analytics / Sports Statistics\nStatistics applied to sports — analyzing player performance, game strategies, and injury risks.\n\n\nEnvironmental Statistics\nStatistics in environmental science — air/water quality, climate data, pollution modeling, conservation research.",
