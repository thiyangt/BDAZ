## Primary vs Secondary Data


### Primary Data

-   Primary data refers to information collected directly by the researcher.

-   This data is gathered specifically to address the researcher’s current problem or objective, tailored to meet the specific requirements of a particular study.

**Methods of collecting primary data**

-   surveys

-   census

-   interviews

-   observational studies

-   experimental studies

-   case studies

-   content analysis

-   ethnography

-   focus groups

-   analyse social media content

### Secondary Data

-   Secondary data refers to information that has already been collected, compiled, and published by others for purposes different from the researcher’s current study.


**Methods of collecting secondary data**

-   Online databases: These databases can be categorized into two main types based on their accessibility: commercial and open-access.

-   Government and Institutional Reports


**Why Secondary Data?**

1.  Cost-Effective (not always)

2.  Time-saving

3.  Preliminary Research: It serves as a valuable resource for preliminary research or background studies, helping to identify gaps in knowledge, formulate hypotheses, and refine research questions.

4.  Historical Analysis: Enables researchers to conduct historical analyses and understand past trends, events, and behaviors, which can inform present and future research directions.

5.  Validation: Secondary data can be used to validate findings from primary data


## Observational Studies vs Experimental Study

### Observational Study

The researcher observes and collects data without manipulating variables.

### Experimental study

The researcher manipulates one or more variables (independent variables) and measures the effect on another variable (dependent variable).

### Example for observational study vs experimental study

Research question: "Investigate the effect of fertilizer A and B on chili crop yield."

Following is how two researchers started the data collection to answer the research question. 

### Researcher 1

**Step 1:** Population: Identify two groups of chili farmers based on the fertilizer they use.

Group A: Farmers using fertilizer A.

Group B: Farmers using fertilizer B.

**Step 2:** Data collection: Collect data on chili crop yield from both groups at the end of the growing season.

### Researcher 2

**Step 1:** Randomization: Randomly assign plots of land to receive either fertilizer A or fertilizer B. Same seed variety is used.

**Step 2:** Control Conditions: Ensure all other conditions (water, sunlight, humidity, soil type) are kept constant across all plots. Use consistent pest management practices and ensure uniform planting and harvesting techniques.

**Step 3:** Data Collection: Measure the chili crop yield from each plot at the end of the growing season.

Here researcher 1 used observation study to collect data and researcher two use experimental study to collect data.

## Population

The [complete collection]{style="color:red;"} of individuals or objects that are of interest.

```{r}
#|echo: false
knitr::include_graphics("ip2.png")
```

Example

We're interested in studying the average height of [all adults in a country]{style="color:blue;"}, the population is all adult residents of that country.

## Unit

A unit is a single member of the population. It could be an individual or an object.

```{r}
#|echo: false
knitr::include_graphics("ip4.png")
```

**Example**

1.  Population

We're interested in studying the average height of [all adults in a country]{style="color:blue;"}, the population is all adult residents of that country.

2.  Unit

In our example of studying adult height, [each adult residing]{style="color:blue;"} in the country would be a unit.

## Sample

A subset of units in a population.

```{r}
#|echo: false
knitr::include_graphics("ip5.png")
```


## Sampling

Sampling is the [process]{style="color:red;"} of selecting a subset of individuals or items from a population.

```{r}
#|echo: false
knitr::include_graphics("ip7.png")
```

## Statistics

A numerical summary of a sample.

<!--A numerical value summarizing the sample data.-->

```{r}
#|echo: false
knitr::include_graphics("ip8.png")
```

## Parameter

A numerical summary of a population.

```{r}
#|echo: false
knitr::include_graphics("ip9.png")
```


## Two Branches of Statistics


### 1. Descriptive Statistics

Describe and summarize the collected data through numerical summaries, tables, and graphs.

### 2. Inferential Statistics

Statistical inference refers to the methods used to make estimations, decisions, or predictions about a population parameters based on the statistics computed from a sample that was selected from that population.

```{r}
#|echo: false
knitr::include_graphics("ip11.png")
```

## Census

A [census]{style="color:red;"} involves collecting information from every individual or unit within the entire population of interest.

## Sample Survey

A [survey]{style="color:red;"} involves collecting information from a subset (sample) of the population to estimate characteristics of the entire population.

## Notations

[Parameters]{style="color:red;"} are usually denoted by Greek letters

Example:

$\mu - \text{population mean}$

$\sigma - \text{population variance}$

[Statistics]{style="color:blue;"} are denoted by English letters (Capital or Simple? You will learn more of this in the "Statistical Inference" section)

Eample:

$\bar{X} - \text{sample mean}$

$S^2 - \text{sample variance}$


-   The value of the population parameter does not change.

-   Sample statistics vary from sample to sample.
